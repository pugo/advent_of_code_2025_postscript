# Advent of Code 2025
*In PostScript!*

By Anders Piniesjö.

This is an attempt to solve the [Advent of Code for 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) 
in PostScript.

## Why
About 27 years or so ago I wrote [PS-HTTPD](https://www.pugo.org/projects/pshttpd), 
a web server in PostScript.
Ten years after that I made PostScript based printer drivers 
for the Opera Web browser. During the years since then, 
I have forgotten most of that quite funky language.
It was time to bring the memories back to life!

## Goal
The goal is that each day's task should be executable on a
PostScript printer. No non standard extensions will be used.
It is possible that some tasks will be very demanding for a
normal printer (e.g. day 8 step 2), but it should still be
possible to print.

During development and for reasonable execution I use
the fantastic Ghostscript. The Ghostscript developers have
provided us a free PostScript intepreter since 1988!

## What is Postscript?
[PostScript (PS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) is a Turing complete page description language
invented by Adobe. It was introduced in 1982. The most recent
version, PostScript 3, was released 1997.

The successor of PostScript is PDF.

## Possible?
Doing Advent of Code in PostScript should be possible. This far
I have done day 1 to 8. Maybe some of the coming tasks
will hit the limits of PostScript, but this far it works!
